# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
for the crate version in `Cargo.toml`.

**MSRV policy:** `package.rust-version` tracks a recent stable (currently **1.97**).
Bumps happen when the project adopts language/stdlib features that require a newer
compiler, or when CI stabilizes on a new stable series. Patch toolchain updates
(e.g. 1.97.0 → 1.97.1) do not require a crate version bump.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07

### Linux performance evidence and per-round diagnostics (2026-07-20)

- **Reproducible H2H Linux protocol.** Rust/Java fork artifacts now carry
  verified per-role affinity, revision/dirty state, source-tree and binary
  hashes, per-fork host snapshots, balanced order and checksum evidence.
- **Controlled bare-metal study.** A 20-pair four-scenario baseline plus
  measurement-only claim-lock, handler-write and PMU/c2c experiments identified
  the checked single-producer atomic RMW as a material x86 fixed cost and shared
  ring-slot writes as a secondary ownership-traffic cost. The unsafe global
  bypass remains explicitly non-shippable.
- **`bench-round-diagnostics`.** New opt-in benchmark feature and
  `--round-diagnostics` runner mode preserve every warmup/measured round with
  per-stage batch-size/queue-depth histograms and producer capacity-wait
  counters. Canonical Rust hot paths compile without these probes.
- **Java probe isolation.** Diagnostic runs generate and hash a temporary,
  source-verified instrumented LMAX `SingleProducerSequencer`; the pinned
  upstream checkout stays unchanged.
- **Diagnostic artifacts.** Reports validate and flatten per-round data to
  `round_batch_diagnostics.csv` and
  `round_producer_backpressure.csv`, while marking probe throughput as
  non-canonical evidence.
- **Documentation.** [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) records the
  Linux/macOS evidence, safety boundary, unresolved batch/padding questions and
  reproduction commands without publishing VPS credentials or operational
  details.

### Pipeline wait/gating LMAX alignment (2026-07-19)

- **Wait availability:** non-blocking strategies (`Yielding`, `BusySpin`,
  `Sleeping`, default timeout poll) now match LMAX: when a barrier has
  upstream dependent sequences, wait only on those sequences; the producer
  cursor is polled only when there are no dependents. Multi-producer
  contiguity still runs after the wait on the barrier.
- **Producer gating:** Builder/`create_disruptor_core` registers **terminal
  stage** consumer sequences only (LMAX last `EventHandlerGroup`), not every
  intermediate pipeline stage. Drain/shutdown still wait on that terminal set.
  Intermediate stages remain enforced via barrier dependencies.

### YieldingWaitStrategy LMAX spin-then-yield (2026-07-19)

- **`YieldingWaitStrategy`** now matches LMAX Java: busy-poll
  `SPIN_TRIES` (100) unsuccessful observations, then `thread::yield_now()`
  on further misses (`apply_wait_method`). Previously every miss yielded
  immediately.
- **Protocol unchanged:** still returns only when `available >= sequence`
  (or Alert/Timeout); alert/shutdown flags are still observed every poll.
  This is a scheduling policy fix for LMAX fidelity, not a semantic change
  to claim/publish/barriers.
- Public constant `YieldingWaitStrategy::SPIN_TRIES` documents the LMAX
  value; unit tests lock the constant and countdown behavior.

### Residual soundness & API closure (2026-07-19 post-fix review)

Closes residuals from the independent post-fix re-audit:

- **Single-producer claim lock.** `SingleProducerSequencer` now rejects concurrent
  claim drivers with `DisruptorError::ConcurrentClaimDriver` (try paths return
  `None`) instead of data-racing on `next_value`/`cached_value` after an
  `unsafe { new }` + shared `Arc`. High-level Builder/`SimpleProducer` typing
  remains the preferred boundary.
- **DSL `try_publish_event` → `Result<i64, TryPublishError>`.** Terminal
  Poisoned/Shutdown are distinct from Full/Contended (breaking for DSL callers
  that matched on `bool`).
- **DSL re-entrant publish.** Nested `publish_event`/`try_publish_event` from a
  translator fails with `ReentrantPublish` instead of deadlocking the claim mutex
  or disordering the single-producer cursor.
- **`try_run_once` panic poison.** Handler panics in the probe path poison
  producers and re-raise, matching `run()`.
- **`batch_publish` capacity validation.** Zero/over-capacity/unrepresentable
  sizes return `InvalidSequence` without panicking.
- **`CloneableProducer` wired.** Multi-mode
  `DisruptorHandle::cloneable_producer()` is the public mint path; single mode
  has no such method (trybuild + compile_fail).
- **Lifecycle queries.** `DisruptorHandle` / DSL `Disruptor` expose
  `is_poisoned()` and `is_claim_closed()`.
- **ElegantConsumer.** Always records `is_poisoned` on handler panic;
  `new_with_sequencer_poison` wires `Sequencer::poison` for fail-fast producers.
- **trybuild UI suite.** `tests/ui/` covers non-Clone producer, no
  `create_producer` / `cloneable_producer` on single-mode handles.

### Try-publish error taxonomy & probe self-activation (2026-07-19 audit — breaking)

Closes the last failure-delivery gap from the 2026-07-19 audit (R1), plus two
regressions found red on `main` while verifying it:

- **`TryPublishError` (breaking).** `Producer::try_publish` /
  `try_batch_publish` (and the `DisruptorHandle` / `CloneableProducer`
  delegates) now return `Result<i64, TryPublishError>`, distinguishing
  *transient* backpressure — `Full(RingBufferFull)`,
  `MissingFreeSlots(MissingFreeSlots)`, or `Contended` after a lost
  multi-producer CAS — from *terminal* states (`Poisoned` / `Shutdown`). Zero,
  over-capacity, and unrepresentable batches return the non-retryable
  `InvalidBatchSize { requested, capacity }` variant. Previously
  every try-path rejection surfaced as "ring full", so the idiomatic
  `Err(_) => retry` loop spun forever on a poisoned or halted pipeline.
  `is_terminal()` identifies terminal pipeline state and `is_transient()`
  alone identifies retryable rejection;
  classification reads the monotonic poisoned/closed flags, so a terminal
  report is always conclusive.
- **`try_run_once` self-activates (regression fix).** The halt-race fix made
  `on_start()` stop setting the running flag — leaving *no* safe way to
  activate `try_run_once` (the only remaining flag-setting path was `run()`
  itself, the exact race the probe exists to avoid). The probe now claims the
  running flag via CAS for the duration of the call — mutually exclusive with
  `run()` and other probes — and releases it on every exit path.
- **Poisoned-pipeline shutdown expectation (test fix).** `Disruptor::shutdown`
  on a poisoned pipeline reports `DisruptorError::Poisoned` (the backlog is
  undrainable with a dead consumer) while still halting and joining consumer
  threads; the integration test now asserts that documented contract instead
  of `unwrap()`ing it away.
- **Docs.** `EventBatch::get` explicitly documents that reading is not
  consuming (un-taken events are redelivered); the DSL `Disruptor` documents
  its single-producer shared-publish mutex; the `Sequencer` trait documents
  that external implementations keeping the no-op `poison`/`close` defaults
  opt out of failure propagation.

Coverage: new `tests/try_publish_errors.rs` (transient recovery end-to-end,
exact deficit, non-retryable invalid batch sizes, poisoned/shutdown on both
try paths); strengthened assertions in `tests/failure_semantics.rs`,
`tests/lifecycle_residuals.rs`, and the poisoned DSL shutdown integration test;
`mpsc_exactly_once_stress` retries only on the transient variant.

### Lifecycle residual closure (post-audit)

Closes the four secondary residuals left after P0–P2:

- **`try_run_once` fatal `on_batch_start`.** Matches the sequential engine:
  failure freezes the sequence, poisons producers, and stops the processor.
- **DSL drain shutdown.** `Disruptor::shutdown` / `shutdown_timeout` now close
  claims, drain the published backlog, then halt; `halt()` is the abrupt path.
  Post-stop publishes return `DisruptorError::Shutdown`.
- **Sequencer close flag.** `Sequencer::close` freezes claims on clean
  halt/shutdown (Builder and DSL). Distinct from poison (failure path).
- **ElegantConsumer panic hooks.** Handler panics are caught; optional
  `*_with_panic_hook` constructors run a hook (e.g. sequencer poison) before
  re-raising. Default constructors still catch+stop without a hook.
- **Verification depth.** Integration tests for publish-after-halt and DSL
  drain; Miri CI expanded with poller prefix-ack, try_run_once fatal, and
  immediate DSL start/shutdown.

### Surface & validation cleanup (2026-07-18 audit P2 round)

- **Dead surface removed.** `Cursored`, `Sequenced`, and `EventSink` traits
  (no implementations or callers) are gone; `DataProvider` is re-exported
  from `disruptor::`. The empty `full-benchmarks` feature is removed.
- **Feature hygiene.** parking_lot's deadlock detector is opt-in via the new
  `deadlock-detection` feature (was unconditional). The four diagnostic /
  benchmark binaries (~4.3K lines) require the new `bench-tools` feature.
  `panic = "abort"` is removed from the release profile — the P1 poisoning
  design depends on unwinding.
- **README is now executable.** Every Rust block compiles and runs as a
  doctest (`#[doc = include_str!]`); the poller example's three
  audit-confirmed errors are fixed, and all examples use the current
  fallible-publish API.
- **CI hardening.** New macOS ARM64 job (clippy + full tests + core-only);
  `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` failures are hard failures under CI
  (previously warnings).
- **Docs accuracy.** Stale `# Panics` sections on the ring-buffer accessors
  removed (mask+cast cannot panic); the DSL is documented as the
  Java-compat surface and `ElegantConsumer` as legacy with its poisoning
  gap called out; the DSL shutdown's fixed 1 ms sleep and redundant SeqCst
  fence are removed.

### Failure & lifecycle semantics (2026-07-18 audit P1 round — breaking)

Silent failure modes identified by the audit are now explicit, delivered
results. Five changes, each breaking for callers of the old signatures:

- **Fallible publishing.** `Producer::publish` / `batch_publish` (and the
  handle/`CloneableProducer` delegates) return `Result<i64>` with the
  published sequence. Failed claims were previously logged via
  `internal_error!` (silent in release without `BADBATCH_LOG`) and dropped —
  `batch_publish(n > capacity)` lost the whole batch invisibly.
- **Panic poisoning** (`DisruptorError::Poisoned`). A panicking consumer
  thread (builder consumers, `BatchEventProcessor::run`) poisons the
  producers: blocking claims fail fast — including from inside the
  backpressure spin loop — instead of spinning forever on a dead gating
  sequence. A panicking producer update closure (or DSL translator) poisons
  the pipeline instead of exposing a never-written slot on the next publish.
  `ElegantConsumer` (extras/legacy) is not yet covered.
- **Handler error policy.** `ExceptionHandler::handle_event_exception`
  returns an `ErrorDecision` (`Stop` / `Continue`). `DefaultExceptionHandler`
  now stops the processor (LMAX `FatalExceptionHandler` semantics) and
  poisons the producers; the old skip-and-continue behavior is opt-in via
  `IgnoreExceptionHandler` or the new DSL entry point
  `handle_events_with_exception_handler`. `on_batch_start` errors are fatal
  instead of discarded.
- **Draining shutdown.** `DisruptorHandle::shutdown()` drains the published
  backlog before stopping (LMAX `shutdown()`), aborting early when the
  pipeline is poisoned or a consumer already died; `shutdown_timeout(d)`
  bounds the drain and reports Timeout/Poisoned/ShutdownError; `halt()` is
  the explicit abrupt stop (old behavior). `Drop` performs a 2s bounded
  drain instead of discarding the backlog.
- **Poller partial commit.** Dropping an `EventBatch` acknowledges only the
  events actually taken via `next_mut`; untaken events are redelivered.
  `ack_all()` is the explicit full-batch acknowledgement (the old drop
  behavior). **Migration note:** `EventBatch::get` only *reads* — a batch
  inspected solely through `get()` and then dropped is redelivered in full;
  call `ack_all()` when read-only access should still commit the batch.

Coverage: `tests/failure_semantics.rs`, `tests/shutdown_semantics.rs`,
poller partial-commit unit tests, and reworked exception-policy integration
tests.

### Soundness (2026-07-18 cross-audit — breaking)

Four independent safe-API undefined-behavior holes, each reproduced under Miri
from `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` callers, were closed. The safe surface shrank;
low-level composition now requires `unsafe` with documented contracts.

- **Producer capability typing.** `SimpleProducer` no longer implements
  `Clone`; `DisruptorHandle<E, W, M>` carries a `SingleProducerMode` /
  `MultiProducerMode` marker and only multi-mode handles have
  `create_producer`. `SimpleProducer::new`, `CloneableProducer::new`,
  `DisruptorCore` and `create_disruptor_core` are crate-private.
  `SingleProducerSequencer::new` is `unsafe fn` (single claim-driver
  contract). Cloning a single-mode producer used to race on the sequencer's
  non-atomic `UnsafeCell` claim state.
- **Ring buffer read access.** `RingBuffer::get` and `DataProvider::get` are
  `unsafe fn`: a safe `&T` could previously be held across a producer write to
  the same slot (Stacked Borrows violation). `Disruptor::get_ring_buffer` is
  removed. `EventPoller::new` and `BatchEventProcessor::new` are `unsafe fn`
  with topology contracts; use `open_single_producer_poller`, the Builder, or
  the DSL, which discharge them internally.
- **Handler exclusivity.** `BatchEventProcessor` keeps its handler behind
  `parking_lot::Mutex` (locked once per `run()`, `try_lock` on cold lifecycle
  methods) instead of `UnsafeCell` + hand-written `Sync`; concurrent
  `on_start`/`try_run_once` used to alias `&mut H`.
- **DSL publish serialization.** `Disruptor` (lmax-dsl) is `Sync` with
  `publish_event(&self)`; in `ProducerType::Single` mode a shared
  `Arc<Disruptor>` could drive the unsynchronized claim path from two
  threads. Single-mode DSL publishing now serializes claim access behind an
  internal mutex (multi mode takes no lock).
- **Claim bounds.** `try_next_n` (single and multi) rejects `n < 1` and
  `n > buffer_size`, and producer-side capacity checks clamp the gating
  minimum to the producer position (LMAX `Util.getMinimumSequence(seqs, min)`
  semantics) instead of treating an empty gating list as `i64::MAX`. A
  capacity-8 sequencer used to accept `try_next_n(1000)` and alias `&mut`
  slots within one batch.

Regression coverage: `tests/soundness_regression.rs`, two `compile_fail`
doctests (producer clone, single-mode `create_producer`), and an extended
Miri CI subset (claim bounds, concurrent lifecycle).

### License

- Project license changed from **AGPL-3.0** to **Apache-2.0** (see `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`).

### Added

- Monomorphized hot path (`WaitStrategy` / barrier / handler generics; no hot-path `dyn`).
- Unified `consumer_engine` loops shared by Builder and BatchEventProcessor.
- WorkerPool CAS work-claim for same-stage parallel mutable consumers.
- Read-only fan-out (`fan_out_events_with`) distinct from WorkerPool.
- EventPoller for user-owned consumer threads.
- 128-byte slot padding option (`CacheLine128` / `with_cache_line_padding`).
- Feature gates: `lmax-dsl`, `extras` (default on); core path works with `--no-default-features`.
- Concurrency verification: loom claim models, MPSC exactly-once stress, Miri CI subset.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable) for local/CI alignment.

### Changed

- Builder module split (`builder/{core,consumer,fluent,handle,entry}`).
- Stage access model: `ConsumerAccess` + `RunMode` (no readonly bool / Option work magic).
- Single `ClosureEventHandler`; `StopFlag` stop model for builder vs BEP.
- MSRV declared as `1.97`.

### Removed / clarified

- Dishonest `Clone` on consumer join-handle ownership paths.
- Dual fluent `ClosureEventHandler` and static stop conventions.
- **`SharedRingBuffer` and feature `shared-ring-buffer`** — was a global `RwLock`
  over the ring (not LMAX protocol). Share via Builder / `CloneableProducer` /
  `EventPoller` instead.
