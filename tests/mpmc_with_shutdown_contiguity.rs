//! End-to-end test for MPMC contiguity with shutdown-aware barrier
//!
//! This test verifies that in a multi-producer setup using the builder pipeline
//! (which relies on `wait_for_with_shutdown` internally), consumers do not
//! advance past gaps (out-of-order publications) and only move forward once gaps
//! are filled. It also verifies that shutdown cleanly stops processing.
